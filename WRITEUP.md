Simplified Deployment and Management:

 Azure App Service abstracts away the underlying infrastructure, allowing you to focus solely on your application code. You don't need to manage the operating system, runtime environments, or underlying infrastructure, reducing administrative overhead.
Scalability: App Service offers automatic scaling capabilities, allowing your application to handle varying levels of traffic without manual intervention. You can scale your application horizontally by adding more instances or vertically by upgrading the resources allocated to each instance.

Built-in High Availability:

 Azure App Service provides built-in high availability and redundancy across multiple Azure data centers. It ensures that your application remains available even if a hardware failure occurs.

Managed Platform:

 With App Service, Microsoft manages the platform, including security patches, OS updates, and runtime updates. This frees you from routine maintenance tasks, allowing you to focus on developing your application.

Integrated Services: 

App Service integrates seamlessly with other Azure services such as Azure SQL Database, Azure Storage and Azure Active Directory used in this app. This simplifies integration and enhances the capabilities of your application.

DevOps Integration:

 Azure App Service integrates with Azure DevOps and other CI/CD tools, facilitating continuous integration and deployment pipelines. You can automate the deployment process, enabling faster delivery of new features and updates.

Cost Efficiency: 

In many cases, Azure App Service can be more cost-effective than running Virtual Machines, especially for smaller applications or workloads with variable traffic patterns. You pay only for the resources your application consumes, and there is no need to provision and manage VMs.
